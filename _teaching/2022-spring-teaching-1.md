I served as a Teaching Assistant for the undergrad course CSE 353 (Machine Learning) under [Prof. Yifan Sun](https://sites.google.com/site/yifansunwebsite) in Fall 2022 and Fall 2023. As a TA, I conducted weekly office hours, graded assignments and exams, and proctored exams. I was fortunate enough to be given an opportunity by the professor to take one lecture on Vector Calculus in Fall 2022.
