I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the course CSE 377 (Introduction to Medical Imaging) under [Prof. Zhaozheng Yin](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~zyin/index.htm) in Spring 2023. I hosted weekly tutorial sessions to help students with assignments and course material, graded assignments and exams, and proctored exams.
