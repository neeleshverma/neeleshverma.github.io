I originate from the enchanting city of [Kanpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanpur) in Uttar Pradesh, India. My educational journey took root in various schools within Kanpur, where I completed both my primary and secondary education. In my formative years, a profound interest in sketches and drawings emerged. Though it experienced a temporary decline, it resurged during my tenure at Samsung, where I actively engaged with sketches and artwork databases. Beyond my professional pursuits, I find immense joy in immersing myself in the world of PC games, particularly those with captivating single-player, story-based narratives.

I am deeply passionate about chess and dedicated a fair amount of my time to honing my skills. Engaging regularly on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/), I maintain a rating of nearly 2000 (in the Rapid section). During my Masters, I actively participated in chess competitions. I aspire to become a titled player.
