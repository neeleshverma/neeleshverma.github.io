<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->
Hi!, I'm Neelesh, an Masters student at the [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), NY in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/). My research interests primarily lies in Computer Vision and Adversarial ML. I have recently developed an interest in Diffusion Models and their applications - Image Segmentation, Object Detection, Shadow Removal, etc.  In Adversarial ML, I enjoy working on crafting of physical and digital adversarial patches, their detection and removal. I am currently working under [Prof. Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/) as a graduate research assistant. We are working on detecting surface cracks using Diffusion models. 

Education
======
Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I worked under [Prof. P Balamurugan](https://sites.google.com/site/pbalamuru/) on Speech Denoising by leveraging feature losses as part of my undergraduate thesis. I also got an opportunity to work with [Prof. Umesh Bellur](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~umesh/index.html) on performance prediction of Apache Spark applications. I completed my bachelors in 2020, spent 2 years in industry and started my MS at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) in Fall 2022 where I am being advised by [Prof. Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/).
